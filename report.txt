1.Describe any design decisions you made. These may be minimal for pa1.
Use ArrayList to implement TupleDesc since it's easy this way to acheive functions like iterator.
Use 4 hashmaps to implement Catalog, same reason as above
Use concurrentHashMap for Bufferpool since it provides thread-safe.

2.Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API.
Nothing.

3.Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.
I think no missing for PA1. It passes all java and ant tests.
I didn't implement the hashcode() for TupleDesc since I haven't used it as keys in any HashMap.

4.Describe how long you spent on the assignment, and whether there was anything you found particularly difficult or confusing.
About one day and a half for me, and roughly same for my teammate. We work together for most time.
I think understanding the whole logic is most difficult.

5.If you collaborate with someone else, you have to discribe how you split the workload.
